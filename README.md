3) Run the installer, specifying a location for the GUI to be installed. Note you can specify that you want a shortcut to the GUI placed on your desktop.
4) Once installed, then either run the GUI from the desktop shortcut, if chosen, or open up the specified location. There should be a subfolder called "application", inside this folder there is BED_calculator.exe, which runs the GUI when opened.

#ISSUES
Any computational issues related to the use of the GUI can be reported on the appropriate GitHub page under "issues". Note Thomas E. Woolley is a mathematician and is unable to supply any help on any particular medical application. These should be directed to the local clinical specialist of the user.

For some reason, when installed from the compiled installer, certain Microsoft Office products interfere with the GUI. If this should occur, restart your PC.  

Whenever a slider is moved the value is recalculated. This may cause older computers to freeze due to the mass of additional calculations.
