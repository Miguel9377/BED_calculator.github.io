## If you do not have windows, cannot get the installer to work, or know what you are doing
You will need a copy of MatLab installed on your computer.

# ISSUES
Any computational issues related to the use of the GUI can be reported on the appropriate GitHub page under "issues". Note Thomas E. Woolley is a mathematician and is unable to supply any help on any particular medical application. These should be directed to the local clinical specialist of the user.

For some reason, when installed from the compiled installer, certain Microsoft Office products interfere with the GUI. If this should occur, restart your PC.  

Whenever a slider is moved the value is recalculated. This may cause older computers to freeze due to the mass of additional calculations.
